The shellcon.exe program is used to perform basic interaction with the
registry, in particular to determine the default web browser (for use with
HTML-based help systems or content viewing) and to determine the ODBC DSN
that are defined.  The latter can be used to populate database selection/login
dialogs.  The program is typically copied to a directory in the PATH or must
be expecitly called with a full path.  It may be phased out in the future.
