<P>CoPlot's versatile drawing objects make it easy to create precise technical 
drawings. Although there are just a few types of drawing objects, each object 
has a large number of attributes which you can edit. The result is that each 
type of drawing object can be used in many different ways. 
<P>To use CoPlot, you: 
<UL>
  <LI><B>Create different types of drawing objects.</B> <BR>Use the 'Create' 
  menu or the buttons on the upper left edge of CoPlot's window. 
  <LI><B>Edit the attributes of the objects until they look like you want them 
  to look.</B> <BR>You can edit objects immediately after you create them or any 
  time afterwards. <BR>Use the 'Edit' menu or the buttons on the lower left edge 
  of CoPlot's window. </LI></UL>
<P><IMG height=493 alt="Screen Shot" src="CoPlot_files/coplot.gif" width=559> <!-- ****************************************************** -->
<P>The types of drawing objects are: 
<UL>
  <LI><A name=pathobjects><B>Path Objects</B></A> - 'Path' objects are a series 
  of points and a group of attributes. Path objects are very versatile because 
  they have line attributes, background attributes, fill (hatch) attributes, 
  arrow attributes, and marker attributes. Whenever possible, CoPlot supports an 
  infinite number of sizes and line widths, not just a few (for example, for 
  fill size, marker size, line width). 
  <P><IMG height=364 alt="Path Objects" src="CoPlot_files/path.gif" width=311 
  border=1> 
  <P>The drawing below illustrates some uses of Path objects. By setting the 
  '<TT>Path Type</TT>' attribute to '<TT>Spline</TT>', it is easy to make nicely 
  curved lines. The '<TT>Background Color</TT>' attribute allows you to color 
  the interior of the wing's outline. Path objects can also be used to draw 
  straight lines and dashed lines (also in the drawing below). 
  <P><IMG height=331 alt="Butterfly Wings" src="CoPlot_files/wings.gif" 
  width=375 border=1> <BR>&nbsp; </P>
  <LI><A name=ellipseobjects><B>Ellipse Objects</B></A> - 'Ellipse' objects in 
  CoPlot are very flexible. They can be made into a large variety of shapes by 
  changing their attributes. 
  <P><IMG height=376 alt="Ellipse Objects" src="CoPlot_files/ellipse.gif" 
  width=510 border=1> <BR>&nbsp; </P>
  <LI><A name=imageobjects><B>Image Objects</B></A> - 'Image' objects can 
  display images from standard image files (.gif, .jpg, .png, etc.). You can 
  change an Image object's attributes to change the image's appearance: size, 
  angle (in decimal degrees), brightness, contrast, cropping margins, etc. And 
  you use other drawing objects to annotate images. 
  <P><IMG height=88 alt=Images src="CoPlot_files/images.jpe" width=514 border=1> 

  <P>Image objects can also display icons (32x32 pixel images). CoPlot comes 
  with thousands of icons arranged in 70 icon groups (animals, plants, people, 
  computers, etc.). Icons look great on screen, but don't look as good when 
  printed. They are very useful for creating diagrams which will be viewed on 
  screen. 
  <P><IMG height=190 alt=Icons src="CoPlot_files/icons.gif" width=451 border=1> 
  <BR>&nbsp; </P>
  <LI><A name=textobjects><B>Text and Big Text Objects</B></A> - Text and Big 
  Text Objects are almost identical. The only difference is that you edit the 
  text for a Text object in a textfield and you edit the text for a Big Text 
  object in a text editor. Thus, Text objects are more suitable for short pieces 
  of text and Big Text objects are more suitable for big blocks of text. 
  <P>Text and Big Text objects in CoPlot can be drawn within a shape. There are 
  about 40 shapes to choose from. This makes it easy to draw block diagrams, 
  flow charts, UML diagrams, organization charts, etc. 
  <P><IMG height=251 alt="Flow Chart" src="CoPlot_files/flow.gif" width=272 
  border=1> 
  <P><A name=tags><B>Tags For Formatting Text</B></A> - Text in CoPlot can 
  include HTML-like tags to control subscripts, superscripts, italics, 
  underlining, bold, etc. For example, '&lt;b&gt;' makes subsequent text bold. 
  CoPlot supports some non-standard tags to help you format mathematical 
  equations. Wherever tags can be used in CoPlot, there is an '<TT>&amp;</TT>' 
  button which pops up a list from which you can pick a tag. Here are examples 
  of most of the tags: 
  <P><IMG height=313 alt="HTML Tags" src="CoPlot_files/tags.gif" width=457 
  border=1> 
  <P><A name=characters><B>Greek and Other Special Characters</B></A> - Text in 
  CoPlot can include Greek and other characters which are picked from lists of 
  HTML-like character entities (ASCII names for characters, for example, 
  '&amp;Aacute;' generates 'Á' and '&amp;mu;' generates 'µ') which are arranged 
  in groups. Wherever character entities can be used in CoPlot, there is a 
  '<TT>&lt;&gt;</TT>' button which pops up a list from which you can pick a 
  character. Here are samples from most of the character groups: 
  <P><IMG height=176 alt="Character Entities" src="CoPlot_files/entities.gif" 
  width=350 border=1> 
  <P>Here is the list of characters in the Math group: 
  <P><IMG height=260 alt="Math Characters" src="CoPlot_files/entity12.gif" 
  width=600 border=1> <BR>&nbsp; </P>
  <LI><A name=dimensionobjects><B>Dimension Objects</B></A> - Dimension objects 
  mark the distance between two points. In the text that is centered between the 
  two points, you can embed a special text <A 
  href="http://www.cohort.com/coplotdrawingobjects.html#tags">tag</A> 
  ("&lt;dimension&gt;") to display the current distance. If the two points are 
  too close together to fit the text, two short arrows are drawn inward to the 
  two points. 
  <P><IMG height=201 alt="Dimension Objects" src="CoPlot_files/dimension.gif" 
  width=341 border=1> 
  <P>There is no special "arc dimension" object. But since ellipse objects can 
  be made into arcs with arrowheads at both ends and with text labels, they can 
  be used to label arc dimensions. In the text for the ellipse's label, you can 
  embed a special text <A 
  href="http://www.cohort.com/coplotdrawingobjects.html#tags">tag</A> 
  ("&lt;arcdimension&gt;") to display the current arc dimension. <BR>&nbsp; </P>
  <LI><B>Graph Objects</B> - Because graph objects are a standard type of 
  drawing object, you can create as many of them as you want anywhere on your 
  drawing. And the extensive drawing options in CoPlot are very useful for 
  annotating graphs. 
  <P><IMG height=183 alt="Graph Object" src="CoPlot_files/graphobject.gif" 
  width=279 border=1> 
  <P>Graph objects are discussed in detail <A 
  href="http://www.cohort.com/coplotgraphobjects.html">here</A>. <BR>&nbsp; </P>
  <LI><B>Pie Charts and Plasmid Maps</B> - Strictly speaking, pie charts aren't 
  a standard type of drawing object in CoPlot. But CoPlot has a "wizard" 
  ("<TT>Create : Pie Chart</TT>") which takes a column with numeric data and a 
  column with labels from a datafile and makes a pie chart or plasmid map by 
  creating several Ellipse objects. You can then further edit the attributes of 
  these ellipse objects if you need to. 
  <P><IMG height=151 alt="Pie Chart" src="" width=331 border=1> <IMG height=234 
  alt="Plasmid Map" src="" width=234 border=1> 
  <P>Note that text label for each Ellipse object can include <A 
  href="http://www.cohort.com/coplotdrawingobjects.html#characters">special 
  characters</A> (for example, Greek and math) and various <A 
  href="http://www.cohort.com/coplotdrawingobjects.html#tags">formatting 
  commands</A> (for example, subscripts and superscripts). 
  <P>If you use "<TT>Create : Pie Chart</TT>" a few times and edit the 
  attributes of the resulting ellipses (notably, their <TT>Size</TT> and 
  <TT>Inner Size</TT>), you can make a multi-pie chart: 
  <P><IMG height=170 alt="Multi-Pie Chart" src="" width=281 border=1> <BR>&nbsp;

<H2>Sample Drawings</H2>
<P>The features of CoPlot described above (different types of drawing objects, 
text tags, and special characters) combine to make it easy to make a broad range 
of technical drawings. Here are some examples. 
<P><B>Electrical Schematics</B> - Because electrical symbols are in one of the 
groups of special characters, it easy to draw electrical schematics. Here are 
the electrical symbols and a simple schematic drawing: 
<P><IMG height=260 alt="Electrical Symbols" src="CoPlot_files/entity3.gif" 
width=600 border=1> <IMG height=191 alt=Circuit src="CoPlot_files/circuit.gif" 
width=186 border=1> 
<P><A name=chemical><B>Chemical Structures</B></A> - CoPlot isn't specifically 
designed for drawing chemical structures, but it has some features which make it 
pretty easy to do. One of the lessons in the program describes how to do it. 
<P><IMG height=227 alt="Chemical Structure" src="CoPlot_files/chemical.gif" 
width=197 border=1> 
<P><A name=landscape><B>Landscape Designs</B></A> - CoPlot has a font with 
landscape symbols, which simplifies the process of making landscape designs and 
field maps. 
<P><IMG height=203 alt="Landscape Design" src="CoPlot_files/landscape.gif" 
width=261 border=1> 
<P><A name=groups><B>Field Maps and Groups</B></A> - In CoPlot, you can assign 
drawing objects to different groups and you can control whether different groups 
are visible or not. Thus you can make field maps where the map is in a 
background group and the crop history for each year is stored in a different 
foreground group (which you can make visible or not). 
<P><IMG height=267 alt="Field Map" src="CoPlot_files/field.gif" width=267 
border=1> 
<P><B>Here are some other drawings made with CoPlot.</B>
